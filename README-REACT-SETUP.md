# Autocross Gallery - React + Tailwind CSS Integration

This guide shows you how to integrate React and Tailwind CSS into your existing gallery.html file. I've provided two approaches:

## 🚀 Quick Start (CDN Approach)

The simplest way to get started is using the `gallery-react.html` file I created. This uses CDN links and doesn't require any build tools.

### Features:
- ✅ React 18 with JSX support
- ✅ Tailwind CSS via CDN
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Interactive lightbox
- ✅ Category filtering
- ✅ Load more functionality
- ✅ Mobile-friendly navigation

### How to use:
1. Simply open `gallery-react.html` in your browser
2. All dependencies are loaded via CDN
3. No installation required

## 🛠️ Advanced Setup (Build Tools)

For a production-ready setup with build optimization, use the Vite-based approach.

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Project Structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Navigation.jsx      # Navigation bar component
│   ├── HeroSection.jsx     # Hero section component
│   ├── Gallery.jsx         # Main gallery with filtering
│   ├── GalleryItem.jsx     # Individual gallery item
│   └── Lightbox.jsx        # Lightbox modal component
├── data/
│   └── galleryData.js      # Gallery photos and categories
├── App.jsx                 # Main app component
├── main.jsx               # React entry point
└── index.css              # Tailwind CSS imports
```

### Key Features:

#### 🎨 **Tailwind CSS Integration**
- Custom color palette (`autocross-*` colors)
- Responsive design utilities
- Custom animations and transitions
- Component-based styling

#### ⚛️ **React Components**
- **Navigation**: Responsive navbar with mobile menu
- **HeroSection**: Attractive hero section with gradient background
- **Gallery**: Main gallery with category filtering and pagination
- **GalleryItem**: Individual photo cards with hover effects
- **Lightbox**: Full-screen image viewer with keyboard navigation

#### 🔧 **Advanced Features**
- **Category Filtering**: Filter photos by category (Racing, Track, Autocross, etc.)
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as needed for better performance
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys and ESC in lightbox
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all device sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and hover effects

### Customization:

#### Adding New Photos:
Edit `src/data/galleryData.js`:
```javascript
{
  id: 17,
  src: "/assets/cars/gallery/new-photo.jpg",
  title: "New Photo Title",
  caption: "Photo description",
  category: "racing" // Use existing categories or add new ones
}
```

#### Customizing Colors:
Edit `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
colors: {
  'autocross': {
    50: '#eff6ff',
    // ... customize your brand colors
  }
}
```

#### Adding New Categories:
Edit `src/data/galleryData.js`:
```javascript
export const categories = [
  // ... existing categories
  { id: 'new-category', name: 'New Category' }
]
```

### Integration with Your Existing Site:

#### Option 1: Replace Current Gallery
1. Replace your current `gallery.html` with `gallery-react.html`
2. Update navigation links in other pages to point to the new gallery

#### Option 2: Keep Both Versions
1. Use `gallery-react.html` as your new React version
2. Keep the original `gallery.html` as a backup
3. Update your main navigation to link to the React version

#### Option 3: Gradual Migration
1. Start with the CDN version (`gallery-react.html`)
2. Later migrate to the build tool version for better performance

### Performance Benefits:

#### CDN Version:
- ✅ No build step required
- ✅ Instant deployment
- ✅ Good for prototyping

#### Build Tool Version:
- ✅ Optimized bundle size
- ✅ Tree shaking (removes unused code)
- ✅ Better caching
- ✅ Production-ready optimizations

### Browser Support:
- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+

### Troubleshooting:

#### Images Not Loading:
- Check that image paths in `galleryData.js` are correct
- Ensure images exist in the `assets/` directory
- Use relative paths starting with `/assets/`

#### Styling Issues:
- Make sure Tailwind CSS is loading properly
- Check browser console for any CSS errors
- Verify that custom CSS classes are defined

#### React Errors:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure all dependencies are loaded
- Verify JSX syntax is correct

### Next Steps:

1. **Test the CDN version** first to see if it meets your needs
2. **Customize the design** by modifying Tailwind classes
3. **Add more photos** to the gallery data
4. **Consider the build version** for production deployment
5. **Integrate with your backend** if you have one

### Deployment:

#### CDN Version:
- Simply upload `gallery-react.html` to your web server
- No build process required

#### Build Version:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist/` folder contents to your web server
3. Configure your server to serve the React app
